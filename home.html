<h1>My hobby</h1>

<h3>I have never liked to be active. </h3>
<h4> Once thought, my friend invited me to go to the gym with him. We did a back workout and I actually enjoyed the idea of being strong. This was 5 years and a half ago. And I never stopped.</h4>
<p> A lot of women struggle with illnesses and cramps, muscle weakness and inability to do basic movements, after the age of 40. One of the most scary ones and also one of the most easily preventable is osteoporosis. Most of them never realize  that it could be fixed with something as simple as weight lifting and progressive overload. </p>

<p> I try and inspire all of my friends to pick up the gym. I even got my dad into it, he started doing home work out every day. Especially my girl friends, because it helps with more than just confidence.  </p>
